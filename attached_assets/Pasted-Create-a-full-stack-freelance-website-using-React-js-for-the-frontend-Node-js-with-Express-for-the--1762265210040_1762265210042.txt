Create a full-stack freelance website using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The website should open with a proper Home Page first, not the login page. The home page must include a brief introduction about the platform and clear buttons for users to either sign up or log in. During signup, users should choose their role as either Freelancer or Client. After signing up successfully, the system should automatically log them in and redirect them to their respective profile page where they can view and edit their details. Both freelancers and clients should have editable profiles containing fields like name, email, bio, skills or company info, hourly rate, and profile picture. When users update their profiles and click “Save Changes,” the data should be sent to the backend, updated in MongoDB, and immediately reflected on the frontend.

Freelancers should have features such as a personalized dashboard showing jobs and proposals, a “Browse Jobs” section listing client projects, a “My Proposals” section for submitted bids, an “Earnings” page with dummy payment functionality, a messaging system to chat with clients, and a profile page for editing personal information. Clients should have their own dashboard showing posted jobs, a “Post a Job” page for creating projects, a “Manage Freelancers” section, a “View Proposals” section to review freelancer bids, a messaging system, a dummy “Payments” page, and a profile settings page. The frontend and backend must be fully connected using REST APIs, ensuring that all user actions (signup, login, post job, edit profile) are reflected in real-time in the database. JWT authentication should be used to secure user sessions, and each user’s role must be verified before accessing protected pages. Role-based access control should be applied—freelancers can only access freelancer pages, and clients can only access client pages. Unauthorized attempts should redirect to an “Access Denied” page. After login, users should be redirected to their role-specific dashboard, and after logout, they should return to the home page. The dummy payment pages should display fake transaction summaries or simulated success messages for design purposes. Overall, the website must start with a home page, allow role-based signup and login, support fully functional profile editing and saving, maintain a live connection between frontend and backend, and properly separate Freelancer and Client experiences while keeping the entire system smooth and connected.
